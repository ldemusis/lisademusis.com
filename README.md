Lisa here! This github repo is for maintaining the website files for my work. It's sort of like a portfolio!
My website has examples of some things I've contributed to teams. You can find current work and past work from my designer days. Fun!
You can also learn a little about me, view my resume, and get my contact info from the about page.
